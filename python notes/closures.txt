Closures in python

A Closure is a function object that remembers values in enclosing scopes even if they are not present in memory. 
It is a record that stores a function together with an environment: a mapping associating each free variable of the function
 (variables that are used locally but defined in an enclosing scope) with the value or reference to which the name was bound when the closure was created.
A closure—unlike a plain function—allows the function to access those captured variables through the closure’s copies of their values or references, 
even when the function is invoked outside their scope. 


# Python program to illustrate
# closures
def outerFunction(text):
 
    def innerFunction():
        print(text)
 
    # Note we are returning function
    # WITHOUT parenthesis
    return innerFunction 
 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    myFunction = outerFunction('Hey!')
    myFunction()
