Functions in python

A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.
A function can return data as a result.In Python a function is defined using the def keyword:

		Example: def my_function():
			  	print("Hello from a function")

Calling a Function
To call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis:

		Example: def my_function():
  				print("Hello from a function")
				   my_function()

Arguments
Information can be passed into functions as arguments. 
Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. 
You can add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma.

		Example:  def my_function(fname):
  				print(fname + " Refsnes")
					my_function("Emil")
					my_function("Tobias")
					my_function("Linus")
By default, a function must be called with the correct number of arguments. 
Meaning that if your function expects 2 arguments, you have to call the function with 2 arguments, not more, and not less.

		Example:	def my_function(fname, lname):
  				print(fname + " " + lname)
				my_function("Emil", "Refsnes")

Arbitrary Arguments, *args: If you do not know how many arguments that will be passed into your function, 
add a * before the parameter name in the function definition.This way the function will receive a tuple of arguments, and can access the items

		Example:	def my_function(*kids):
 			      print("The youngest child is " + kids[2])
				my_function("Emil", "Tobias", "Linus")
