conditional statements
A conditional statement as the name suggests itself, is used to handle conditions in your program. 
These statements guide the program while making decisions based on the conditions encountered by the program.

Python has 3 key Conditional Statements that you should know:

			if statement
			if-else statement
			if-elif-else ladder
if Statement:
The if statement is a conditional statement in python, 
that is used to determine whether a block of code will be executed or not.
	
syntax: if condition:
       	 # execute code block
if-else Statement:
 The if statement executes the code block when the condition is true. 
Similarly, the else statement works in conjuncture with the if statement to execute a code block when the defined if condition is false.

Syntax:	if condition:
      	  # execute code if condition is true
	else:
       	 # execute code if condition if False
if-elif-else ladder:
The elif statement is used to check for multiple conditions and execute the code block within if any of the conditions evaluate to be true.
The elif statement is similar to the else statement in the context that it is optional but unlike the else statement, 
there can be multiple elif statements in a code block following an if statement.

syntax: 	if condition1:
    			# execute this statement
		elif condition2:
   			 # execute this statement
		else:
   			 # if non of the above conditions
   			 # evaluate to True
   			 # execute this statement
