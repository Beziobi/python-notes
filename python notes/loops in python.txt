Loops in Python
 Python provides three ways for executing the loops. While all the ways provide similar basic functionality, 
they differ in their syntax and condition checking time.

While Loop in Python

In python, a while loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied.
 And when the condition becomes false, the line immediately after the loop in the program is executed.
	
	Syntax :	while expression:
  			  statement(s)

For Loop in Python
For loops are used for sequential traversal. For example: traversing a list or string or array etc. 
In Python, there is no C style for loop, i.e., for (i=0; i<n; i++). 
There is “for in” loop which is similar to for each loop in other languages. 

	syntax:for iterator_var in sequence:
   			 statements(s)

Nested Loops
Python programming language allows to use one loop inside another loop.

	Syntax: for iterator_var in sequence:
   			for iterator_var in sequence:
       		statements(s)
       		statements(s)
