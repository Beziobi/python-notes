Decorators

Decorators are a very powerful and useful tool in Python since it allows programmers to modify the behaviour of a function or class. 
Decorators allow us to wrap another function in order to extend the behaviour of the wrapped function, without permanently modifying it.

					Syntax for Decorator: @gfg_decorator
								    def hello_decorator():
   								    print("Gfg")

							'''Above code is equivalent to -

								def hello_decorator():
   								 print("Gfg")
    							hello_decorator = gfg_decorator(hello_decorator)'''
