Data Types

Since everything is an object in Python programming, 
data types are actually classes and variables are instance (object) of these classes.

Following are the standard or built-in data type of Python:

Numeric:- represent the data which has numeric value. Numeric value can be integer, floating number or even complex numbers. 
These values are defined as int, float and complex class in Python.

Sequence Type:-In Python, sequence is the ordered collection of similar or different data types. 
Sequences allows to store multiple values in an organized and efficient fashion. 
There are several sequence types in Python –
						
					String
					List
					Tuple

Boolean:-Data type with one of the two built-in values, True or False. 
Boolean objects that are equal to True are truthy (true), and those equal to False are falsy (false). 
But non-Boolean objects can be evaluated in Boolean context as well and determined to be true or false. It is denoted by the class bool.

         Note – True and False with capital ‘T’ and ‘F’ are valid booleans otherwise python will throw an error.


Set:- Set is an unordered collection of data type that is iterable, mutable and has no duplicate elements. 
The order of elements in a set is undefined though it may consist of various elements.
					Example:-set1 = set() 
						   print("Initial blank Set: ") 
						   print(set1)

Dictionary:-Dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of data values, used to store data values like a map, which unlike other Data Types that hold only single value as an element,
 Dictionary holds key:value pair. Key-value is provided in the dictionary to make it more optimized. Each key-value pair in a Dictionary is separated by a colon :, whereas each key is separated by a ‘comma’.
					Example:-Dict = {} 
						   print("Empty Dictionary: ") 
						   print(Dict)
