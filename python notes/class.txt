class in python

A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. 
Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. 
Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state.

		Syntax: class ClassName:
    				# Statement

Some points on Python class:  Classes are created by keyword class.
					Attributes are the variables that belong to a class.
					Attributes are always public and can be accessed using the dot (.) operator. Eg.: Myclass.Myattribute

Defining a class : class Dog:
    				pass

Class and Instance Variables
Instance variables are for data, unique to each instance and class variables are for attributes and methods shared by all instances of the class.
